                  Data volumes are exploding. As a result, many businesses use SAP, a platform for enterprise resource planning (ERP), to manage their separate systems in a single location,
                  ranging from systems for customer relationship management and business intelligence to resource planning and supply chain management. SAP’s flagship ERP offering or SaaS
                  solutions like SuccessFactor or Aribba are highly flexible and are mission-critical software for many businesses that use it, but it can also be exceptionally difficult and
                  costly to work with and customize.

                  In fact, SAP business workflows are so complex that in-house SAP support is no longer an option for many organizations. Even though SAP is meant to make wrangling multiple
                  systems more efficient, accessing data from SAP and getting in to the right people at the right time is still challenging and time-consuming. As a result, decisions are
                  slower and less-effective, causing business to suffer.

              <p>SAP applications are central to how most enterprises manage financials, logistics, human resources, manufacturing and other
                lines-ofbusiness (LOB) systems. SAP’s flexibility makes it a powerful tool for meeting business needs, but it can require extensive
                support to implement effectively. Productivity can be slowed down by time-consuming and expensive customizations, especially when
                trying to integrate SAP with other mission-critical systems
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether making schedules, running reports or hiring new staff, all managers are looking for the same thing — data. They need
                mission-critical business information to make decisions, and the faster the data is accessible, the faster they can make better
                decisions. If the data is hard or slow to access, then the business can suffer from poor decisions and overall lack of visibility.

              <p>
                  LOB managers don’t care if the data is on-premises or in the cloud; they want access from anywhere—home, work, mobile, vacation.
                  They also expect workflows across multiple systems to be seamless, without requiring a heavy lift from a time and resource perspective.

                    <strong>1. Complexity / Lack of Agility</strong>
                    <p>When organizations need to implement change quickly, SAP’s complexity impedes agility. Many organizations use SAP to store mission-critical
                      info that can feed into dozens of different business processes. When customizing SAP apps, it can be difficult to access and use this information,
                      making app development more costly and time consuming. </p>

                    <strong>2. Complicated User Interface (UI)</strong>
                    <p>SAP is known for its complex UI. For many users, searching for information using the SAP UI is difficult and time consuming, if not sometimes downright
                      impossible. Business apps that require access to SAP data can run into similar inefficiencies, especially if the development platform uses the native SAP UI or
                      makes multiple connections into SAP for the same data. Inefficient SAP integration can make it difficult for business users and business apps to access critical
                      information from SAP production systems.</p>

                    <strong>3. Technology Silos</strong>
                    <p>Even when organizations are standardized on SAP for the bulk of their business processes, they inevitably still keep data in other systems. Non-SAP solutions can
                      be overlooked or forgotten, creating technology silos that hamper efficiency. When integrations are attempted, many business apps fail to provide an easy and
                      consistent user experience across the various connection points between SAP and other solutions.

                      they no more than get an app working than the business user changes the workflow, cycling the process back to the beginning. What’s more, the underlying
                      data in SAP systems is still tough to integrate with other data sources and line-of-business applications. </p>

                    <p>SAP is often used to store an organization’s mission-critical information. Governance and compliance protocols often require lengthy approval cycles that can
                      decrease productivity. Business applications designed to improve efficiency can easily fall short on basic security measures like tracking and auditing, while a sole

              <h3>What is Low-Code?</h3>
              <p>
                Low-code platforms are similar to website builders in that they give you an intuitive, drag-and-drop
                interface, except instead of building websites, you can build applications for streamlining business processes,
                from leave requests to sales quotes to reporting. Low-code platforms make it remarkably easy to assemble
                and implement applications to handle a wide variety of business processes. In place of labor-intensive coding
                projects that spread IT resources thin, organizations can respond quickly to changes in business or the
                market by making and editing SAP apps on demand.

              <p>
                When most people think of SAP app development, they imagine needing a developer to write the code. Low-code platforms with a drag-and-drop designer not only
                enable IT to build business apps faster since minimal coding is needed, but “citizen developers” (a.k.a. less-technical users outside of IT) can also solve their own
                process problems by creating workflows for themselves. Enabling business users to develop their own apps helps reduce the IT bottleneck, while allowing IT
                departments to retain the option to conduct final review passes and ensure quality control.

                    <p>
                      SAP often houses data that is difficult to access. Low-code SAP apps enable you to deliver SAP data to decision makers at the moment they need information to
                      make data-driven business decisions. Also, making the most of SAP means designing business workflows that integrate SAP with other line-of-business services,
                      such as SharePoint, Salesforce and Oracle. Easy integration eliminates data silos and allows enterprises to design processes to how people work, instead of
                      changing how people work to match software limitations.

                    <strong>Increase SAP User Adoption</strong>
                    <p>
                      Low-code SAP apps increase user adoption by stripping away the complexities that make SAP so challenging to use. By providing a simple and intuitive user
                      experience, low-code apps bridge the gap between SAP data and users, enabling users to work with information that may be stored in SAP without having to go
                      into SAP and navigate through multiple screens to get it. This also allows businesses to continue to access data without needing to buy hundreds of SAP
                      licenses, since data stored in SAP can be surfaced directly in business apps.

                      Even the most technical users appreciate working in a familiar environment. For example, developers who use Visual Studio will be more efficient making new
                      SAP apps if they can use visual drag-and-drop tooling from within Visual Studio. Developers get the benefit of a familiar and more efficient development
                      environment without extensive coding.

                      Even non-technical users can drag and drop the components they need with no coding necessary. Instead of a developer hand-coding a new app, a business
                      user with an immediate problem can assemble an app to meet their own needs. The IT team retains oversight of newly created SAP apps while reducing their
                      overall workload.

                    <p>
                      Inaccessible SAP data is a hidden cost for enterprises. Users spending countless hours looking for the right data wastes resources. Decisions based on
                      incomplete or out-of-date data can lead to large direct and indirect expenditures. Then, of course, there’s the direct cost of hiring full-time employees to
                      manage SAP and code custom apps to make it work. A low-code business application platform is the quickest way to achieve business value. With a low-code
                      visual designer, SAP apps are easy to create and rollout, users easily find the data they need to make data-driven decisions, and IT can either develop more
                      quickly themselves or oversee citizen developers.

                    <p>
                      Traditional custom workflows for SAP are created by specialized developers at great time and expense. Changing these workflows is equally slow and costly,
                      hampering business agility. A low-code platform with the right process automation capabilities allows organizations to rapidly respond to changing business
                      needs and circumstances with easy, click-and-drag SAP app creation. SAP business process automation allows organizations to quickly test, learn and pivot.
                      Solutions can be delivered in hours or days instead of the weeks and months required for hand-coded apps, resulting in immediate feedback from customers,
                      partners, and employees.

                      Look for a dashboard that allows you to review, analyze and approve information across lines-of-business and across systems. Use drag-and-drop visual tools to
                      create ad-hoc forms and reports as needed, then monitor those reports from the dashboard to gain visibility into business processes.

                    <p>
                      Security and compliance must be maintained, so choose a low-code platform that has put as much thought into security as it has into its visual editor. You
                      should be able to speed up approval cycles while maintaining governance and compliance. You must have the ability to stay within the security parameters
                      established by each system. Look for an easy and intuitive change management system, as well as integration with email client(s) to ensure that approving,
                      rejecting or requesting more information can be done from a single click within an email. You should also be able to build applications with auditing and
                      tracking capabilities to ensure all data movement conforms to governance protocols.

              <p>
                SAP systems are complex, and enterprises need help to get SAP data out of silos and delivered to decision makers — at the right time,
                on any devices, and online or offline. A low-code platform enables organizations to address SAP business process problems in real time
                by enabling people to quickly and easily build apps, as-needed, and under the care and supervision of IT, that deliver value across the
                business.
